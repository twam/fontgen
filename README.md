fontgen
========

This is a small command line utility for generating font files for Embedded Systems from TrueType or OpenType fonts.

The most important features are:

* Full Unicode Support
* Easy selection of character sets or single characters
* Support for multiple output formats. Currently there are
    * BMP (for debugging)
    * twam (My own proprietary format)

For installation help, follow the instructions into the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/twam/fontgen/wiki/Installation).
